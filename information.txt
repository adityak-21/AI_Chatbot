          BRIDGE GAME
=================================

Introduction
Bridge is a trick-taking card game played with a standard 52-card deck. Four players are divided into two partnerships. Partners sit opposite each other at a square table. The game proceeds through four main phases: dealing, bidding, playing, and scoring.

Setup
1. Four players form two partnerships.
2. Partners sit opposite each other.
3. Use a standard 52-card deck.
4. Assign directions: North, East, South, West.

Dealing
1. Shuffle the deck thoroughly.
2. Deal 13 cards to each player.
3. Each player should have 13 cards in hand.
4. The dealer rotates clockwise each round.

Bidding
1. The bidding phase determines the contract.
2. The dealer starts the bidding.
3. Bids must increase in rank or be a pass.
4. The bidding ends when three consecutive players pass.
5. The final bid becomes the contract.
6. The player who first names the suit (or no-trump) in the final contract is the declarer. Their partner becomes the dummy.

Playing
1. The player to the left of the declarer leads the first trick.
2. Players must follow suit if possible.
3. If unable to follow suit, a player may play any card.
4. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick unless a trump is played.
5. The highest trump wins if a trump is played.
6. The winner of the trick leads the next trick.

Scoring
1. The declaring side scores points if they make the contract.
2. Overtricks (extra tricks taken) add bonus points.
3. Undertricks (failing to meet the contract) result in penalties.
4. The scoring system rewards achieving the contract and penalizes failures.
