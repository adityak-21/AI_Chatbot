What is Dassbridge?
Hello, I am Chanchal Dass. I started playing contract bridge at the age of sixteen and soon became passionate about the game. To revolutionize how bridge tournaments are conducted, I conceptualized and developed the DassBridge app. This app is for playing online tournaments, as well as hybrid mode(a very special feature for users to enjoy playing offline without worrying about any malpractices or scoring faults). It is designed to automate and enhance offline tournaments using smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Dassbridge supports variety of bridge games like pair games, team games, auction bridge, rubber bridge, solitaire, enriching the overall bridge experience.

Dassbridge turns any group of computers into a lively bridge tournament. It works on any desktop system, letting players bid, play cards, and see their scores easily. Spectators can watch the games and enjoy the excitement. Players can confirm their moves, adding more suspense, and choose from four different card designs. There's no need to worry about server IP addresses because the app connects players automatically. It supports different tournament setups for small and large groups and provides accurate scoring. Players can replay past games and save them as files to share and remember.

What is a bridge game?	
Contract bridge, or simply bridge, is a trick-taking card game played by four players in two partnerships. It’s a complex game that involves bidding, strategy, and communication between partners.

	
How to play bridge game?
1. Introduction to Bridge:
Bridge is a trick-taking card game played with a standard 52-card deck. It involves four players in two partnerships sitting opposite each other. The game progresses through a  series of deals, each divided into two phases: the bidding and the play. The objective isto score points by making bids and winning tricks.
2. Setup and Dealing:
- Players: Four
- Partnerships: Two teams of two
3. Understanding Card Values:
Each player estimates the value of their hand using the following High Card Points (HCP) system:
- Ace: 4 points
- King: 3 points
- Queen: 2 points
- Jack: 1 point
Total the points in your hand to evaluate its strength.
4. Suit Ranking and Order:
The suits in the bridge have a specific ranking order, from highest to lowest:
1. No Trump (NT)
2. Spades (♠)
3. Hearts (♥)
4. Diamonds (♦)
5. Clubs (♣)
5. Bidding and the Auction:
The auction phase determines the contract, or the number of tricks a team commits to winning, and the trump suit, if any.
1. Start of Bidding: The dealer makes the first call, which can be a bid, pass, double, or redouble.
2. Bids: A bid includes a number (1-7) and a suit or no trump (e.g., 1♣, 2♦, 3♥,    4♠, 1NT). Each bid must be higher than the previous bid.
3. Pass: Indicates no bid.
4. Double: A call that increases the scoring stakes for tricks or penalties, made in response to an opponent’s bid with no other bids intervening.
5. Redouble: A call that boosts the stakes further after an opponent doubles, allowed only if there are no bids between the double and your call.
6. Ending the Auction: The auction ends when three consecutive players pass. The highest bid becomes the final contract.
Contract Example:
If the highest bid is 4♠, the team must win 10 tricks with spades as the trump suit.
6. Playing the Hand:
Roles and Responsibilities
1. Declarer: The player who first mentioned the contract suit. They control both their own hand and the dummy’s hand.
2. Dummy: The partner of the declarer. Their hand is displayed face-up on the table after the opening lead.
3. Defenders: The opponents of the declarer, who aim to prevent the declarer from fulfilling the contract.
Playing Tricks
1. Opening Lead: The player to the left of the declarer plays the first card.
2. Playing Cards: Players must follow suit if possible. If they cannot, they may play any card, including a trump.
3. Winning Tricks: The highest card in the suit led wins the trick unless a trump card is played.
Sequence of Play
- The dummy’s cards are placed face-up.
- The declarer plays both their own and the dummy’s cards.
- The highest card wins the trick, and the winner leads the next trick.
7. Scoring:
Trick Points
Points are scored only for tricks above six, called "odd tricks":
- No Trump: 40 points for the first odd trick, 30 points for each subsequent trick.
- Hearts/Spades: 30 points per odd trick.
- Diamonds/Clubs: 20 points per odd trick.
Bonuses
- Part Score: Announced if fewer than 100 points are scored from tricks. Adds a 50-point bonus.
- Game: Achieved by scoring at least 100 points from tricks. Adds a 300-point bonus.
- Slam: Bonuses for winning all 13 tricks. 500 points if not vulnerable, 750 points if vulnerable.
Undertricks
If the declaring side fails to meet the contract, the defenders score points for each trick short:
- Non-vulnerable: 50 points per undertrick.
- Vulnerable: 100 points per undertrick.
Rubber Bonuses
- Winning a Rubber: Achieved by winning two games. Adds a 500-point bonus if the opponents have won one game, or 700 points if they haven’t won any.
8. Tips and Strategies:
For Declarers
- Plan the Play: Evaluate your hand and the dummy to determine how many tricks you can take.
- Count Losers: Identify potential losers and plan to reduce them.
For Defenders
- Lead Strategy: Lead from a sequence of high cards or your longest suit.
- Signal Partner: Use low or high cards to signal your partner about your hand's strength.
General Advice
- Communication: Use the bidding phase to communicate with your partner about the strength and suit preferences.
- Practice: Bridge is a game of skill; practice regularly to improve your strategy and understanding.
